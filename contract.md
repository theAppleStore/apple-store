Daily process
  - Morning standup at 10:30am everyday to go over yesterday’s tasks, today’s tasks, and blockers
  - Decide pairs that we will be starting with
  - We switch partners after every completed task
Team expectations
  - When merging, at least one person who DID NOT write the code must review it before approving changes and merging with master 
  - It is okay to work after hours as long as other team members are kept up to date
  - If you finish your task after hours, update the GitHub project board and slack our group channel to update everyone
  - Be communicative about individual needs and time management strategies 
Issues
  - If two or more members disagree and a compromise CANNOT be agreed upon, we will vote to decide
  - In the event of a tie, we as a group will have a brief discussion and each side will present arguments
  - If a member gets frustrated:
    - First, take a break! Go for a walk! And then come back to the code.
    - Next, ask for help from a team member! 
    - If there’s a time crunch, ask for help and/or pair program
    - Before placing a help ticket:
      - Ask all members of the team and only if help is still needed then do we submit a help ticket
